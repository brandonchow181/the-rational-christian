\section{Nominalizations}
\paragraph{What Is A Nominalization?} \\
According to the Oxford Dictionary, to nominalize something is ``to form (a noun) from a verb or adjective, e.g. output, truth, from put out, true". A nominalization is a word that has been nominalized. \\
\paragraph{Examples Of Nominalizations} \\
The following are nominalizations.
\begin{itemize}
  \item "Communication" (from "communicating something")
  \item "Depression" (from "feeling depressed")
  \item "Love" (from "loving someone/something")
\end{itemize}
The following are not nominalizations.
\begin{itemize}
  \item "Book"
  \item "John"
  \item "Falsehood"\footnote(Note that a falsehood can exist without someone saying a falsehood)
\end{itemize}
Once you understand what a nominalization is, you recognize that "nominalization" is itself a nominalization since the word is formed from the verb "to nominalize". \\
\paragraph{Nominalizations Cannot Be Understood Without The Verb/Adjective They Derive From} \\
Notice that not all nouns are nominalizations, but only those that can only be made sense through the verb/adjective that the nominalization is based upon. \\
For example communication is a nominalization because the word "communication" has meaning only if it describe someone communicating to someone else. Someone may point out that nominalizations do not always have this feature by indicating that the definition of communication according to the Oxford Dictionary is ``the imparting or exchanging of information by speaking, writing, or using some other medium". However, notice that the definition of communication contains more nominalizations such as "imparting" or "exchanging" or "information", all of which can only be understood through something being imparted or something being exchanged. \\
